## Tecnologies and libraries used

### React

This project was made entirely using React! Their components proved to be very useful creating a site of the likes on this one. This allows me to create complex UIs and navigations!

### Sass

I used Sass in order to sytlize the page! Its nested classes allowed me to keep the code organized and easily editable. It also goes along very well with...

### Bootstrap

Without this awesome toolkit it'd have taken me years to design and implement all the components of the website. From carousels, cards, and even buttons, this library game the right tools for this project more times than I can count.

### React-Bootstrap

A framework that makes the integration of Bootstrap components much easier. This tool simulates Bootstrap elements as React components in the code! Making it look much cleaner and easier to read.

### React Router Dom 

One of the best libraries for React navigation, this one allowed me to implement seamless navigation in my website, along with several other advantages like dynamic links and rendering!

### React Favicon

Just to update the favicon!
